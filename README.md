# RPS-cards
A python multiplayer card game based on rock paper scissors mechanism
To run this game you need 2 or more computers connected to same network

The host should run the server.py script. 

And everyone should run main.py script and then connect to the server using ip adress
then one person can create a game and others can join.

gameplay is bit confusing but you will figure it out by playing a couple of times ;)
